Just a "quick" warm-up exercise ðŸ˜€

## Design Questions

### Does the player know where they are on the map or does the map know where players are?

- players don't block each other
- map already has a lot to track (although players will have to as well)

## Ideas

### basic movement (always max) and map

Is the map a graph?
Is the map complete from the start with most locations empty or are locations added and removed as the game progresses?

#### Movement Options

- from the current node
  - do I have more moves available
  - for each next node
    - is the node empty
      - yes: add it to the options
      - no: recurse over node children
